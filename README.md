# Pin-Tracker-Flutter
Hello! This is a project I made in 11/2019 for a visit to Disney World. It tracks hidden mickey Disney pins 
you want or already have. I used the app on android but I built in in Flutter so if you have a mac you should 
be able to build the app for ios without much trouble. I found the pictures of the pins several Disney 
pin collectors forums.

This app contains every hidden mickey pin released in Disney World from about 2008-2019.

This repo includes 2 python files, one used imagemagick to help slice up and name images 
of pin sets, the other I used to generate the sql to add each set to the sqlite database I was using.

TODO: 
Unzip and organize the project so it is readable. 
Figure out a better way to host the images and clean them up. 
Add 2020 pins. 
Refactor the whole project to make it readable and maybe make people want to contribute.
